# Biometric Attendance System

This biometric attendance system is a time and attendance tracking system that allows staff or teachers to organize courses, manage students and mark students' attendance using their most unique physical characteristicsâ€”their fingerprints. It's built with computer vision (Python OpenCV), Flask and the MERN stack. Inspired by Gideon Idoko's original repository.

**NB**: This system has been built and tested with The DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 scanner only. It only supports Windows OS for now.

Download and install the client for windows here: [HID DigitalPersona Client](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12QCh311WQ-_PIkMHeXqNRfTkbIWnnSdY/view?usp=sharing)

## Features

- **Student Management**: Add, edit, and manage student profiles with biometric data.
- **Course Management**: Organize and assign courses to students.
- **Biometric Attendance Marking**: Use fingerprint scanning for secure and accurate attendance tracking.
- **Manual Attendance Marking**: Option to mark attendance manually if needed.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports on attendance, student performance, and audit logs.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for staff and administrators.
- **Audit Logging**: Track all system activities for compliance and security.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, SCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL with Prisma ORM
- **Biometric Matching**: Python, OpenCV, Flask
- **Fingerprint Scanner**: DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500
- **Other**: JWT for authentication, Joi for validation

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- MySQL Database
- DigitalPersona U.are.U 4500 Scanner and Client Software

## Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database named `bioattendancesysdb`.
2. Set up environment variables in `server/.env` with your database credentials (e.g., DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS, DB_NAME).
3. Run database migrations using Prisma: `npx prisma migrate dev`.

## Usage

- Access the React frontend at `http://localhost:3000` after starting all servers.
- Login as a staff member to manage students, courses, and attendance records.
- Use the DigitalPersona scanner for biometric attendance marking or opt for manual marking.
- Generate reports from the Reports section for attendance analytics.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides RESTful APIs for various operations. Key endpoints include:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Staff login
- `GET /api/students` - Retrieve students
- `POST /api/students` - Add a new student
- `POST /api/attendance/mark` - Mark attendance
- `GET /api/reports/attendance` - Get attendance reports

For full API documentation, refer to the server routes and controllers.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three sections:

1. `client` (frontend)
2. `server` (core backend)
3. `server-py` (matching backend)

## Getting Started

To start the system on Windows, open 3 terminals:

Terminal 1 - Python server:
```
cd bio-attendance-sys-master/server-py
python -m venv venv  <<< for first time use only
venv\Scripts\activate
python server.py
```

Terminal 2 - Node backend:
```
cd bio-attendance-sys-master/server
npm install <<< for first time use only
npm run generate:dev <<< for first time use only
npm run server:dev
```

Terminal 3 - React frontend:
```
cd bio-attendance-sys-master/client
npm install <<< for first time use only
npm run dev
```
