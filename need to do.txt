Can u possibly modify/improve the UI interface and make it look better, and as well as add these modules below, and make sure it also works and connects well across the system. 
(the fingerprint capturing and matching already works, so BE REALLY CAUTIOUS AND POSSIBLY DON’T CHANGE ANYTHING ON THAT PARTS- unless its necessary, we use a 1:N identification match method. And also don’t remove the part where the staff/admin can see the actual fingerprint being scanned/enrolledreal time literally- its really good for authenticity and accuracy)
A Fingerprint Attendance Monitoring System for Bula South Central Elementary School!!!
Make sure it all works.
Make sure EVERYTHING is in the system! 
Design an easy simple Fingerprint-Based Attendance Monitoring System for Bula South Central Elementary School to improve attendance accuracy and streamline record-keeping.
System Name should be: FP Attendance System
; below: Bula South Central Elementary School
Year, 2025 (depending on the accurate day/year of what is today)

Core Modules & Features:
1.	User Management Module
Student Management:**
Register and manage student profiles (name, grade, class/section(should be typed only), ID).
Include filters by Grade, Section, and sorting options (e.g., by last name), Student Search by name, ID or grade, section.
Attendance history- track and view individual student attendance records.
Stores the fingerprint image data with a warning message, 
Note: The system is exclusively used by admin staff, who have access to this module for managing all user accounts and data.
2.	Fingerprint Enrollment Module
Enrollment: Register fingerprints for students.
Include filters by Grade, Section, and sorting options (e.g., by last name).
Verification: Confirm fingerprint accuracy during enrollment.
Update/Delete Fingerprints: Manage stored fingerprints (update or delete).
3.	Attendance Monitoring Module
Check-in/Check-out: Record attendance when a fingerprint is scanned.
Continuous Check-in/Check-out: This is a crucial modification. The attendance module will feature an automated marking/ continuous scanning function that doesn't stop after a single scan. Whether a student is checking in or checking out, the system will always be ready for the next scan, eliminating the issue of the scanner "closing" or needing to be reset between students.
Real-Time Monitoring: Display current attendance status.
Manual Button for marking students absent when they didn’t scan their fingerprints after the grace/late period.
Daily Attendance Log: Store records for each day.
Filters, student search, color coded status (green for present, red for absent, yellow for late)

4.	Scanner Status Indicator:**
Display real-time messages such as "Scanner Connected" or "Scanner Not Connected" within the UI to inform users about scanner connection status.
Hardware Compatibility & Communication:**
Detect device connection status via USB and handle accordingly.
5.	Data Management Module
Database Management: System already uses mysql(don’t use any other database!!!), Store user profiles, fingerprint templates, attendance logs.
Backup & Restore: Data backup options to prevent data loss.
6.	Comprehensive Reporting & Analytics Module
Attendance Reports: Generate detailed reports per student(summarize attendance for an individual student), class, or grade.
Absence Reports: List students absent on specific days.
Statistical Analysis: Attendance trends over time.
Filters: By Date, Grade, Section, Attendance Status (Present/Late/Absent/Early Departure).

Performance and insights: attendance percentage- calculate attendance percentages for students/classes, low attendance alerts- generate reports for students with low attendance, trend analysis- analyze trends for attendance patterns, comparison reports- compare attendance across section, grade.
On the reports page, above, should have a comprehensive chart analysis from each filter categories- anything you can think of for the reports module would be great- the more details the better, make sure that the contents there matches the results when a user uses the filter.
7.	Login and register process already works in the system- just need to improve UI interface. Add an eye icon on the password section to toggle the visibility of the password- If its not yet implemented.

Additional Functionalities to Incorporate:
Button Functionality:**
Ensure all UI buttons (Add, Edit, Delete, Save, etc.) are programmed for reliable operation.
Scanner Status Indicator:**
Clearly display real-time scanner connection status within the UI. (it actually automatically realistically detects that a fingerprint scanner is connected, like:  {deviceConnected && <Text>NB: Fingerprint scanner is connected</Text>},, some of this connected parts are  written on bio-attendance-sys-master\client\src\components\MarkAttendance.tsx and bio-attendance-sys-master\client\public\modules\websdkv1.js ,, bio-attendance-sys-master\client\src\components\AddStudent.tsx – and/or you can just look into everything to better understand the whole system.))
